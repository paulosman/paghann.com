        First off, we&#8217;d like to commend you on your bravery for clicking this
        link. We realize New Orleans is a long haul for most of you, and we&#8217;re
        chuffed that you&#8217;d consider going the distance for our nuptials (and
        the bourbon shower that ensues - we know your M.O as well as you know
        us).
      </p>
      <p>
        Below is every conceivable detail that you need to know for making
        plans for the date. Whenever you&#8217;ve reached a verdict, please remember
        to RSVP so that we&#8217;re ready for you.
      </p>

      <h3>THE WHEN:</h3>

      <p>
        We&#8217;ll be getting married on Saturday March 8th, 2013 with
        festivities starting around 2pm. We suggest you arrive for
        Friday evening and stay until Sunday evening at a minimum, as
        we&#8217;ll be coordinating meals, excursions to clubs and general
        group revelry throughout the weekend.
      </p>

      <h3>THE WHERE:</h3>

      <p>
        We&#8217;re getting hitched poolside at Maison De Macarty in The Bywater.
      </p>

      <p>
        We&#8217;ve already booked out the house for the weekend, but Paul
        has employed his web wizardry to build you an {{#link-to 'listings'}}AirBnb map{{/link-to}} so
        you can find the perfect abode in areas we&#8217;ve pre-screened for
        you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alternately, try searching Kayak or Priceline for affordable
        hotel rates. Here&#8217;s a map so you can plot your travel
        distance, but keep in mind that taxi&#8217;s in the crescent city
        are ridiculously affordable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also keep in mind that the cheapest flights are usually posted
        8 weeks in advance (so 2nd week of January) and the best
        booking dates are Tuesday night through Thursday night. Bonne
        chance!
      </p>

      <h3>THE LOLWUT?:</h3>

      <p>
        Look, we don&#8217;t have every detail hammered out just yet (out of
        sloth) - but we&#8217;re both event planners by vocation, so just
        put your little hand in ours and we&#8217;ll contact you via the
        mailing list after you RSVP with more need-to-knows, meet-ups
        and restaurant locations etc. as we inch towards the date.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ready? Super (we&#8217;re not!) - go ahead and <a title="Wedding in New Orleans" class="guestlist-event-203457 guestlist-link">RSVP</a>.

      <p>FAQ for the locals (you know who you are):</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Show up at The Extension Room (30 Eastern Ave, Toronto) at
          7pm on April 11th. Come hungry and thirsty - you know what
          to expect from us by now, but if you have any questions,
          read on.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>FAQ for the Out-of-Towners (ditto):</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The Extension Room is a pretty cool dance studio located at
          30 Eastern Ave in downtown Toronto. Ample parking is
          available in the area (both on the street and in zoned lots)
          and you can grab all the driving directions you need by
          clicking on the map below:
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>
          As additional methods of transport, Go Trains run from
          Burlington and all stations westbound from there every hour
          if you want to save yourselves the hassle. You can also
          check out a hotel directory for the evening here.
        </li>
        <li>
          We&#8217;ll be serving southern food (everything from savoury hush
          puppies and gulf oysters to pecan pies and sweet teas)
          earlier in the evening, and we&#8217;ll have lots of
          americana-inspired drinks served by very lovely staff (and
          possibly a rogue bartending bride).
        </li>

        <li>
          Dress code is southern charmer- if you want to play it safe,
          dress for business casual or cocktail party. If you want to
          come in a white suit with a kentucky knot tie or as a cast
          member of Designing Women, you&#8217;re basically our favourite
          person. If you come in a hoodie and jeans, we still love
          you.
        </li>

        <li>
          This is world&#8217;s colliding, so expect a diverse group of
          goodkind folk. Relatives take note: you&#8217;re going to hear the
          words "Ruby on Rails", "Javascript MVC", "Functional
          Programming" and "Object Relational Mappers" - asking more
          questions out of curiosity or rolling your eyes are both
          appropriate responses.
        </li>

        <li>
          You&#8217;re probably going to get an earful of early jazz meets
          60&#8217;s garage meets 90&#8217;s alternative. Deal with it.
        </li>

        <li>
          Finally, we love that you&#8217;re coming out to celebrate with
          us. Please, no gifts! If you are wonderful and stubborn, a
          charitable donation to an institution of your choice would
          be absolutely lovely. Three of our favourites are:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.vocpri.ca/" target="_blank">CPRI (Child and Parent Resource Institute, London)</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://secure2.unxvision.com/SLF/eDonation/index.asp?DONATION_FORM_ID=16" target="_blank">The Stephen Lewis Foundation</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.actoronto.org/home.nsf/pages/donate" target="_blank">ACT (AIDS Committee of Toronto)</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Any other need-to-knows will be sent to you via email before the event
        - please RSVP so that we have your email address on Ô¨Åle and can count
        your pretty head!
      </p>

      <p>
        Y&#8217;all ready? Go ahead and <a title="Reception in Toronto" class="guestlist-event-203466 guestlist-link">RSVP</a>.
